Hi, here are some explanations of the general module I built.

First, the shell file contains all the input input from its user,
its publisher, and its execution. I divided the input of the input (the user's command)
into separate functions and performed most of the operations in the run () function.
I also created a separate function for each command that
Shell supports, these functions execute the above commands
(adding characters for example to our character pool).
Also, in the module we allow the user to decide where he wants to export the
output of our software, to what type of file.

Second, I improved the performance of the program by adding HashMap
data structures into the BrightnessCharMatcher class, the sub-images
that make up our overall image will be preserved in this data structure
and in each clarity calculation we will quickly check whether this image
has been processed by us or not (identical sub-images may be Assuming they are small enough).

Explanation of my picture - as you remember, 2020 was not an easy
year at all for all of us, because the new year is upon us, get a joke and
a reminder of how bad 2020 was (true, it has been a year since but 2020 will be remembered forever).

Have fun!
